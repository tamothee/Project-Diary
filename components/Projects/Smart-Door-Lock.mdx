    Description

  <div>
    This is a project done during one of my semester in Singapore Polytechnic
    with a duration of 2 months. The goal of this project was to create a smart door lock with 
    IoT security in mind. For this project, due to time constraints IoT security was the first priority superseding 
    other features including practical features.
