  <div>
    This website is where I log all interesting and noteworthy 
    projects that I have worked on for future reference as well as 
    to showcase them.

  <div className='text-xl tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white'>Background</div>
  <div>
    Prior to this project, I had ReactJS and expressJS 
    experience from my internship with Singapore Polytechnic as a full stack
    developer creating IoT dashboards. I wanted this project to be deployable 
    and fast which is where the popular NextJS came to my mind. I heard NextJS 
    in passing during my internship but I did not have time to learn it. After 
    my internship, I did some research on NextJs and I was impressed by its 
    versatility and refinement that I wanted to learn and implement NextJS 
    on at least 1 project.

  <div className='text-xl tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white'>Ideation</div>
  <div>
    The first step that I took to create this website is to first 
    think about how I want the website to look like. I wanted 
    to have a <a className='underline text-blue-500' href='https://www.youtube.com/c/BongoCat'>bongo cat</a> 
    theme for this project with some animation. With this vague 
    criteria I had in my head, I went to look for inspiration. I came 
    accross <a className='underline text-blue-500' href="https://www.craftz.dog/">Takuya Matsuyama</a> 
    website as well as his tutorial on how he built his website. I really liked 
    his design of his website so this website is heavily inspired by his website.

  <br/>

  <div className='text-xl tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white'>NextJS</div>
  <div>
    Since I did not have any experience with NextJS, I went to look for a tutorial on it. 
    After a quick search, I landed on 
    <a className='underline text-blue-500' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P8mASSREYM&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgC9mj0qv972IO5DmD-H0ZH">Codevolution</a>
    tutorial playlist. This tutorial was so in depth I was surprised it was not a paid 
    tutorial. After a week of following this tutorial, it was time to move on to the next step.

  <br/>

  <div className='text-xl tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white'>ThreeJS</div>
  <div>
    The next step of the process was to learn how to add in 3d characters 
    and animation into a NextJS website. Takuya Matsuyama tutorial was a little hard 
    for me to follow as he was using vim so I used another tutorial instead. 
    <a className='underline text-blue-500' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxvSHOrBHbw&list=WL&index=1'>DesignCode</a> 
    has a wonderful tutorial where he easily explains the basics of how to use threeJS, React Three Fiber and 
    React Three Drei. After a few hours of playing around and learning how to 
    add in 3d characters and models, I started looking for a bongo cat model that 
    I like.

  <div className='text-xl tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white'>Blender</div>
  <div>
    The next step that I took to create this website is to first 
    create a character that I like and implement it to this project. 
    At first I wanted to just import someone elses bongo cat design but I was 
    not happy with those that are free online. So, I took things in my own 
    hand and started learning and creating the character myself. Oh boy I was 
    not ready for how hard Blender is. Nevertheless, I continued learning and creating 
    the character. Due to time constraint, I did not try to add in animation to the character.

  <div className='text-xl tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white'>Combine!</div>
  <div>
    Finally, the last step is to combine all of them into a NextJS webapp and deploy it to vercel.
