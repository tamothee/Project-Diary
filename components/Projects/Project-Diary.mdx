<div>
  This website is where I log all interesting and noteworthy 
  projects that I have worked on for future reference as well as 
  to showcase them.
</div>

<br/>

<div className='text-lg'>This is a Markdown sub-heading</div>
<div>We just used a `###` subheading in our blog post.></div>

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
    const doStuff = () => {
      return console.log('hey')
    }
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

```
  // this is a code block
  const doSomething = () => {
    return console.log('hey')
  }
```

<div>Here, I'm using a component inside my MarkDown file: {<Button text={"Click me"}/>}</div>
