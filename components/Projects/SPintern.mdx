      This project was done during my internship in Singapore Polytechnic. I was tasked to
      do a condition monitoring and vehicle tracking dashboard for a fleet of autonomous vehicle in
      Singapore Polytechnic.

    <div>
      Previously, there was a node red dashboard that tracks the vehicle sensors like speed,
      humidity, and temperature. However, this dashboard was only visible locally on that
      particular vehicle. This was a problem as there were plans to increase the fleet 
      size. With the increase in fleet size, there was a need for remote monitoring of multiple 
      vehicles at once.

      A few key features stuck out during discussion with the supervisors. The features were, 
      live camera feed, live sensor reading, location tracking, sensor logging (saving to database) 
      and graphs for the logged sensor data. 

      <br/>
      
      I used MQTT to send data over to a Javascript server where I pre-process the data 
      like checking for duplicate data before sending it over to the database. The database 
      chosen was MySQL server because I was already familiar with it. I used an IP camera 
      because there was 1 lying around in the lab and there was a router with a sim card on 
      the vehicle where I can connect the IP camera. I chose ReactJS and MUI as it was the most 
      popular frameworks which was important to the supervisors. I used ffmpeg to convert 
      the IP camera RTSP to hls. Then, I used a Javascript server to play the hls video over to 
      the dashboard. I used react-chartjs-2 for the graph visualisations of the logged sensor data. 
      For the live sensor data, I just polled the server every 5 seconds to keep server client parity 
      rather than directly connecting the dashboard to the MQTT server. Node-red was used to manage 
      the sensors as well as the MQTT protocol. The MySQL database and node-red server was pushed 
      to a Huawei Cloud that was done up by my supervisor.

      No github repository will be given as I was not given permission to open the code to the 
      public.
